<a id="Overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
    <p><i>Venturous</i> is a random playback manager, which uses media player's
    command line interface. Currently only <i>Audacious</i> media player is
    supported, but adding support for other players should be quite simple.</p>
    <p><i>Venturous</i> is built around one feature, which is missing from most
    (maybe even all) media players: user-defined items for random playback. This
    feature is especially useful for grouping separate tracks that are
    actually parts of one composition. For example, parts of classical music
    compositions (movements) are often distributed as separate tracks - either
    separate audio files or separate entries in the <i>cue</i> file. It is
    usually desirable to listen to the movements in succession
    and in a proper order.</p>
    <p><i>Venturous</i> features a tree-like playlist, which reflects files' and
    directories' location. Each item (file or directory) in playlist tree can be
    marked as playable. Items that are marked as playable can be sent to
    external player's [temporary] playlist. Normal workflow is the following:
    after external player's playback is finished, <i>Venturous</i> selects next
    random playable item, sends it to temporary playlist and starts playback.
    So, effectively, random playback of user-defined items is achieved.</p>
    <p>The simplest way to group several audio files in one playable item is to
    place them in common directory, add it to <i>Venturous</i> playlist, mark it
    as playable and unmark or remove underlying auto-marked nodes (if any).
    Another way to group audio files is providing metadata (cue) file, which
    contains entries for all files in the group, and adding it to playlist tree.
    </p>
    <p><i>Venturous</i> features playback history, which allows user to identify
    previously played items and play them again.</p>
    <p>Custom actions similar to those in <i>Thunar</i> file manager are
    available in playlist's and history's context menus. Custom actions allow
    user to open selected items in external application.
    For example: open in file manager or in media player, edit text file,
    move item(s) to trash.</p>
    <p>Another nice feature of <i>Venturous</i> is graceful quit.
    In many popular desktop environments
    <i>Audacious</i> would not save playback
    state if it was running while user shut down / restarted / logged out.
    <i>Venturous</i> does save its state in these cases in most popular desktop
    environments. Furthermore, since <i>Venturous</i> manages <i>Audacious</i>,
    it also ensures that <i>Audacious</i> quits in time and thus saves
    <i>Audacious</i> playback state too.</p>
    <p><i>Venturous</i> saves preferences, playlist, backup playlist and history
    separately for each user by default.
    Default <i>Venturous</i> preferences directory location is
    <i>~/.config/venturous</i> (here '~' expands to current user's <i>HOME</i>
    directory).
    Preferences location can be configured at <i>Venturous</i> compile time
    (<i>PREFERENCES_DIR</i> CMake cache variable).
    There is <i>Preferences directory</i> action in Venturous <i>File</i>
    menu that provides quick access to preferences files in file manager.</p>


<a id="Requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a>
    <ol>
        <li><i>qt4</i> OR <i>qt5</i> shared libraries (<i>Core</i>, <i>XML</i>
        and <i>GUI</i>/<i>Widgets</i> modules)</li>
        <li><i>Audacious</i> (managed Audacious mode in <i>Venturous</i> - which
        is <i>not</i> the default mode - requires Audacious 3.4 or later).</li>
        <li><i>audacious</i> and <i>audtool</i> executables must be present in
        <i>PATH</i>. There are two problems with this requirement in MS Windows:
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Audacious <i>bin</i> directory is not added in <i>PATH</i>
            environment variable automatically.
            User has to manually add it there.</li>
            <li><i>audtool</i> is usually unavailable in Windows at all.
            With <i>audtool</i> missing only basic <i>Venturous</i> features
            work. The biggest problem is that stopping playback does not work in
            this case, which prevents <i>Venturous</i> from normal functioning.
            </li>
        </ol></li>
        <li><i>notify-send</i> from <i>libnotify</i> (optional - for desktop
        notifications)</li>
        <li><i>Song Change</i> Audacious plugin (optional - for detached
        Audacious mode, which is the default mode). This plugin is usually
        unavailable in MS Windows, so Windows users have to switch to the
        managed mode.</li>
    </ol>


<a id="AddingFiles"><h2>Adding files to playlist</h2></a>
    <p>Adding files can be done in playlist edit mode. There are menu actions
    (<i>Playlist</i> menu) and toolbar buttons that allow adding individual
    files or recursively add directories. There are also options on toolbar and
    in preferences that influence adding directories policy.</p>
    <p><i>Venturous</i> adds two types of items in playlist tree: files and
    media dirs. <i>Add files</i> or <i>Add media dirs</i> checkboxes in
    <i>Adding directory</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i> must be checked to enable
    adding these items. Alternatively,
    adding these items can be enabled/disabled via corresponding toolbar
    buttons: <i>Consider adding files</i>, <i>Consider adding media dirs</i>.
    </p>
    <p>Naturally, not all files or directories will be added in playlist tree.
    Only files that match checked <i>File patterns</i> and directories that
    contain (directly!) files that match <i>Media directory file patterns</i>
    will be added. These patterns can be configured in
    <i>Adding directory</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i>.
    Only metadata patterns are enabled in <i>File patterns</i> by default.
    This means that only <i>*.cue</i> files will be added as playable items.
    All audio patterns supported by <i>Audacious</i> are enabled in
    <i>Media directory file patterns</i> by default. This means that all
    directories that directly contain audio files will be added as
    playable items (assuming that <i>Add media dirs</i> is enabled).</p>
    <p>A conflict situation is possible with adding directories: when both
    adding files and media dirs is enabled, and media dir contains files that
    match <i>File patterns</i>. Adding both directory and its files might be
    undesirable. This situation is designated as <i>If both...</i>.
    There are two checkboxes in <i>Adding directory</i> tab of
    <i>Preferences</i> for fine-tuning adding behavior in this situation.
    There are also two corresponding buttons on toolbar.</p>
    <p>See also <a href="#EditingPlaylist">Editing playlist tree</a></p>
    <a id="AddingExample">
    <h3>Usage example: adding different categories of music</h3></a>
        <p>Assume that we have 3 categories of music: individual audio
        file, directory with interconnected files, large audio file + cue
        file. How to add these all to <i>Venturous</i> playlist?
        It can be done as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate music that belongs to these categories in 3
            directories. Let us name them <i>files</i>, <i>dirs</i> and
            <i>cue</i> respectively.</li>
            <li>Check <i>Add media dirs</i> in <i>Adding directory</i> tab of
            <i>Preferences</i> (or <i>Consider adding media directories</i> on
            toolbar). Uncheck <i>Add files</i> in <i>Adding directory</i> tab of
            <i>Preferences</i> (or <i>Consider adding files</i> on toolbar).
            Trigger action <i>Add directory</i> and select <i>dirs</i>.</li>
            <li>Uncheck <i>Add media dirs</i> and check <i>Add files</i>.
            Make sure that only default file patterns are checked (all metadata
            patterns) in <i>Adding directory</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i>.
            <i>Add directory</i> -> select <i>cue</i>.</li>
            <li>Go to <i>Adding directory</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i>.
            Select any item in <i>File patterns</i> list to transfer focus.
            Press <i>CTRL+A</i> to
            select all file patterns. Press <i>Space</i> to invert all file
            patterns' checked states. Press <i>Escape</i> to close
            <i>Preferences</i> window (changes are applied automatically).
            <i>Add directory</i> -> select <i>files</i>.</li>
        </ol>


<a id="PlaylistTree"><h2>Playlist tree</h2></a>
    <p>Playlist tree is protected from accidental changes. Protection is
    achieved by introducing two modes: non-edit (default on
    <i>Venturous</i> start) and edit mode.
    Playlist's background is greenish in non-edit mode and purplish
    in edit mode.</p>
    <p>Checked items are considered for random playback selection and can be
    played manually by activating (double click) in non-edit mode.
    Extended selection is available in both modes (multiple items can be
    selected with <i>SHIFT</i> or <i>CTRL</i> keys; <i>CTRL+A</i> selects all
    items). Pressing <i>Enter</i> or <i>Return</i> key starts playing all
    playable descendants of selected items in both modes.</p>
    <p>Apart from obvious folding/unfolding nodes using '+' symbol, there are
    other ways of changing playlist view. Double clicking playlist entry
    folds/unfolds it, but be aware that it also activates it in non-edit mode,
    so if the entry is playable, it will be played.
    The following keys for manipulating current
    entry folded state are supported (these are the standard <i>Qt</i> key
    bindings, so excerpts from <i>Qt</i> documentation follow):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Up</i> - moves the cursor to the item in the same column
        on the previous row.
        If the parent of the current item has no more rows to navigate to,
        the cursor moves to the relevant item in the last row of the sibling
        that precedes the parent.</li>
        <li><i>Down</i> - moves the cursor to the item in the same column
        on the next row.
        If the parent of the current item has no more rows to navigate to,
        the cursor moves to the relevant item in the first row of the sibling
        that follows the parent.</li>
        <li><i>Left</i> - hides the children of the current item (if present) by
        collapsing a branch.</li>
        <li><i>Minus</i> - same as <i>Left Arrow</i>.</li>
        <li><i>Right</i> - reveals the children of the current item (if present)
        by expanding a branch.</li>
        <li><i>Plus</i> - same as <i>Right Arrow</i>.</li>
        <li><i>Asterisk</i> - expands all children of the current item
        (if present).</li>
        <li><i>Page Up</i> - moves the cursor up one page.</li>
        <li><i>Page Down</i> - moves the cursor down one page.</li>
        <li><i>Home</i> - moves the cursor to an item in the same column of
        the first row of the first top-level item in the model.</li>
        <li><i>End</i> - moves the cursor to an item in the same column of
        the last row of the last top-level item in the model.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is a related option in <i>General</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i>:
    <i>Auto unfolded levels in the tree</i>.
    It determines how many levels of the tree are unfolded by default.</p>


<a id="EditingPlaylist"><h2>Editing playlist tree</h2></a>
    <p>When <i>Venturous</i> starts, playlist is in non-edit mode.
    User has to check menu action <i>Edit mode</i> in <i>Playlist</i> menu
    or toolbar button with the same name in order to enter edit mode.</p>
    <p>In edit mode selected items can be removed by pressing
    <i>Delete</i> key. If an item is removed, all its descendants are also
    removed recursively. Single item can be checked/unchecked by mouse-clicking.
    Pressing one of the following keys while playlist has focus will apply
    the corresponding action to all selected items:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Insert</i> - check</li>
        <li><i>Backspace</i> - uncheck</li>
        <li><i>Space</i> - toggle checked state</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When user triggers action that requires edit or non-edit tree
    mode enabled, and if this mode is not currently active, dialog appears,
    asking if user wants to switch edit mode.</p>
    <p>Adding files and directories is also enabled only in tree edit mode.
    For more information about adding items to playlist see
    <a href="#AddingFiles">Adding files to playlist</a></p>
    <p>There are several additional actions in <i>Playlist</i> menu:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>Clean up</i> - removes all items that are not playable and have
        no playable descendants.</li>
        <li><i>Clear</i> - removes all items from playlist.</li>
        <li><i>Restore previous</i> - restores playlist that was used before
        the last saved playlist.</li>
        <li><i>Load ...</i> - loads previously saved playlist. Note: loading
        <i>items</i> file from <i>Venturous</i> preferences directory is
        equivalent to cancelling unsaved playlist changes;
        loading <i>items.backup</i> file is equivalent to
        <i>Restore previous</i> action.</li>
        <li><i>Save as ...</i> - saves current playlist to the file
        selected by user.
        Playlist tree must be in non-edit mode in order to be saved.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While playlist is being edited, old saved playlist is used for random
    playback. Trigger <i>Apply changes</i> action in <i>Playlist</i> menu to
    save changes and start using edited playlist.
    Trigger <i>Cancel changes</i> in the same menu to
    cancel editing without saving. Alternatively, unchecking <i>Edit mode</i> in
    menu or toolbar will show a dialog that asks whether changes have to be
    saved.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to manually edit playlist tree. It is stored in
    <i>&lt;Venturous preferences directory&gt;/items</i> file in plain text
    format.
    Note that tabs should not be replaced by spaces in this file. Only tab
    character designates tree level indentation.
    <i>items.backup</i> file in the same directory has identical format.</p>
    <p>In case of urgent <i>Venturous</i> quit (such as an urgent quit notice
    from desktop environment), if playlist is in edit mode,
    changes are applied and saved.</p>


<a id="ManagingPlayback"><h2>Managing playback</h2></a>
    <p>There are two modes of interaction between <i>Venturous</i> and
    <i>Audacious</i>: <i>detached</i> (default) and <i>managed</i>.</p>
    <p>In the <i>detached</i> mode <i>Venturous</i> stores certain
    <i>Audacious</i> settings in the <i>Audacious</i> configuration files
    (these modifications are reverted when the user switches to the
    <i>managed</i> mode). These automatically set settings ensure
    that <b><i>ventool&nbsp;next</i></b> command is called by the
    <i>Song Change</i> <i>Audacious</i> plugin when playback of the current
    <i>Audacious</i> playlist reaches an end. Note that since the
    <i>detached</i> mode depends on <i>Audacious</i> configuration files,
    issues are possible if <i>Venturous</i> is launched before these files are
    created or after <i>Audacious</i> is updated.
    The workaround to restore settings:
    open <i>Venturous</i> Preferences window; switch to <i>managed</i> mode;
    close <i>Venturous</i> Preferences window;
    open it again, switch to <i>detached</i> mode and close
    the Preferences window.</p>
    <p>In the <i>managed</i> mode <i>Venturous</i> invokes <i>Audacious</i> with
    the <i>-q</i> command line option and controls the <i>Audacious</i>
    process. <i>Venturous</i> assumes that the current
    <i>Audacious</i> playlist reaches an end whenever
    <i>Audacious</i> process exits. Of course, this is not always the case -
    <i>Audacious</i> may be closed by the user, the process also exits when
    the user triggers <i>stop playback</i> action in <i>Audacious</i>.
    This possibly confusing behavior combined with the constant restarting of
    <i>Audacious</i> defines problems with the <i>managed</i> mode. Also note
    that this mode requires <i>Audacious</i> version 3.4 or later
    (because the <i>-q</i> command line option was introduced in 3.4).
    But the <i>managed</i> mode is not without advantages: since
    <i>Venturous</i> has an access to <i>Audacious</i> standard and error
    output, common issues are detected and the appropriate error messages
    are shown by <i>Venturous</i>.</p>

    <p>There are three playback statuses: <i>stopped</i>, <i>paused</i> and
    <i>playing</i>.
    <i>Stopped</i> status means that <i>Audacious</i> is not running or that
    playback is stopped; <i>paused</i> - playback is paused; <i>playing</i> -
    playback is active.</p>
    <p>There are nine actions, <i>External player</i> and <i>History</i>
    submenus in <i>Playback</i> menu. All these 9 actions and all 4 actions from
    the <i>External player</i> submenu are available as <i>ventool</i> commands.
    Five most common actions and two actions from <i>External player</i> submenu
    are present on toolbar and in notification area icon context menu.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>Play</i> - launches external player (if needed) and continues
        playing whatever was played the last time in that external player
        (<i>Audacious</i>).</li>
        <li><i>Pause</i> - pauses playback.</li>
        <li><i>Stop</i> - exits external player.</li>
        <li><i>Previous</i> - plays previous item from history.</li>
        <li><i>Replay last</i> - plays current item from history.</li>
        <li><i>Next from history</i> - plays next item from history.</li>
        <li><i>Next random</i> - plays random item from playlist.</li>
        <li><i>Next</i> - if <i>Next from history</i> option is enabled in
        preferences, tries <i>Next from history</i> action first. If the option
        is disabled or there is no next item in history,
        triggers <i>Next random</i> action.</li>
        <li><i>Play all</i> - plays all playable items from playlist.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Common behavior of the last six actions
    (all except <i>Play</i>, <i>Pause</i> and <i>Stop</i>):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In case of success, external player playback is started with the
        specified item(s) in a temporary playlist.</li>
        <li>In case of failure (no corresponding item in history or
        empty playlist), <i>Stop</i> action is triggered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>External player</i> submenu contains four actions:
    <i>Show window</i> and <i>Hide window</i>, which allow to show/hide
    <i>Audacious</i> main window; <i>Set essential options</i> that allows to
    set necessary external player playback options manually;
    <i>Update status</i> that allows to query
    external player playback status manually.</p>
    <p>All external player's functionality - both actions and options - is
    also available to the user. Recommended <i>Audacious</i> options
    (can be configured in Audacious settings):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Playlist</i> -> <i>Continue playback on startup</i> - continues
        playing track from the saved position, not from the beginning.</li>
        <li><i>Plugins</i> -> <i>General</i> -> <i>Status icon</i> - displays
        Audacious icon in notification area (enable it only if your
        desktop environment / window manager supports application icons in
        notification area).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apart from described above <i>Next from history</i> option,
    <i>Playback</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i> contains
    <i>History</i> options and other playback options:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>External player</i> - allows user to choose the preferred mode
        of interaction between <i>Venturous</i> and <i>Audacious</i>.</li>
        <li><i>Always set external player options</i> - this option is on
        by default, which ensures that external player is configured properly.
        But if the user
        desires to change those options manually to achieve some peculiar
        behavior or if he never changes them and wants to save CPU cycles,
        switching setting options off can be useful.</li>
        <li><i>Always hide external player window</i> - allows to hide
        <i>Audacious</i> window each time player is launched.
        This option is especially useful if <i>Audacious</i> notification area
        icon (<i>Status Icon</i>) is disabled and the <i>managed</i> mode of
        interaction is used.
        In this case hiding external player window prevents <i>Audacious</i>
        window popping up annoyance.
        Note that with <i>Audacious Status Icon</i> disabled,
        user has to issue <b><i>audtool&nbsp;mainwin-show&nbsp;on</i></b>
        command or trigger <i>Show external player window</i> action in
        Venturous <i>Playback</i> menu / toolbar in order to show
        <i>Audacious</i> main window after hiding it.</li>
        <li><i>Exit external player on quit</i> - if enabled, external player
        would be exited when <i>Venturous</i> quits; otherwise it would remain
        running. This option is available only in the <i>detached</i> mode
        because the external player must be exited when quitting in the
        <i>managed</i> mode.</li>
        <li><i>Update status regularly</i> and <i>Status update interval</i> -
        allow to set the time interval at which <i>Venturous</i> would query
        <i>Audacious</i> playback status in order to display the correct status
        to the user in the <i>Venturous</i> window. This option is not important
        for <i>Venturous</i> functioning, but it may prove convenient for the
        user. Note that this option increases CPU usage in idle state
        substantially, especially in case of small time interval,
        so it is disabled by default.</li>
        <li><i>Desktop notifications</i> - if enabled, desktop notification is
        shown after played item is changed. If <i>notify-send</i> executable
        from <i>libnotify</i> is not available in <i>PATH</i>, notifications
        will not be shown and this option should be
        turned off to avoid starting useless process.</li>
        <li><i>Startup action</i> - allows triggering one of
        four playback actions on <i>Venturous</i> start.
        Note that more sophisticated startup behavior can be
        achieved with <i>Ventool</i> commands. For example:<br />
        <b><i>venturous&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;1&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;ventool&nbsp;previous</i></b><br />
        command allows to play previous item from history at the start.
        See also <a href="#Ventool">Ventool and global shortcuts</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Usage example: enable searching and playing music in <i>Audacious</i>
    as an alternative to tree playlist in <i>Venturous</i></h3>
        <p><i>Audacious</i> supports multiple playlists in tabs.
        So the following can be done:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all your music to <i>Venturous</i> playlist in your
            preferred way (see
            <a href="#AddingExample">Adding directories example</a>).</li>
            <li>Trigger <i>Play all</i> action.</li>
            <li>Rename <i>Audacious</i> temporary playlist <i>Now Playing</i> to
            <i>All music</i> (playlist tab context menu has <i>Rename ...</i>
            action).</li>
        </ol>
        This way you can use <i>Venturous</i>, which will always add files to
        <i>Now Playing</i> playlist, and have another permanent <i>Audacious</i>
        playlist with all your music.


<a id="PlaybackHistory"><h2>Playback history</h2></a>
    <p>Playback history displays previously played items (latest on top).
    History can be exported to plain text file and imported from file in the
    same format. These actions are accessible in <i>History</i> submenu
    of <i>Playback</i> menu. This submenu also contains <i>Clear</i> action,
    which removes all entries from playback history.</p>
    <p>Extended selection of entries is supported. Pressing one of the following
    keys while <i>History</i> window is active, will
    apply corresponding action to all selected entries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Enter</i> (or <i>Return</i>) - start playback
        of selected entries.</li>
        <li><i>Delete</i> - remove selected entries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If history entry is activated (double click), playback of this entry is
    started. Pressing <i>Backspace</i> key sets current history index to -1
    (this index is also set when multiple items are played).
    The effect of pressing <i>Insert</i> key varies depending on the number
    of selected entries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If no entries are selected, has no effect.</li>
        <li>If one entry is selected, it becomes current.</li>
        <li>If multiple entries are selected, result is equivalent to pressing
        <i>Backspace</i> key.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>History</i> options are available in
    <i>Playback</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Maximum size</i> - maximum number of entries in history.
        Big number of history entries (more than several thousands) can cause
        performance issues, so this value is limited.
        <i>&lt;Maximum size&gt;</i> latest entries are stored in history.</li>
        <li><i>Copy played entry to top</i> - allows to record items,
        replayed from history, thus providing more accurate playback log.
        The downside of copying entry to top is that it makes navigating
        history further than penultimate entry inconvenient
        (impossible with <i>Previous</i> action).</li>
        <li><i>Number of hidden directories</i> - allows to hide first
        <i>N</i> directories (or, if negative, leave last <i>-N</i> components)
        of item path in <i>History</i> window and status bar.
        It is useful because
        usually first directories are common for all or almost all entries.
        For example, all items in playlist could start with
        <i>/home/&lt;user name&gt;/Music/</i>.
        It is preferable then to hide this common prefix.
        Note that absolute path is always available in tooltip
        both for <i>History</i> entries and for status bar label.</li>
    </ul>


<a id="Ventool"><h2><i>Ventool</i> and global shortcuts</h2></a>
    <p>Command line tool that controls <i>Venturous</i> is built and installed
    with <i>Venturous</i> by default (switching off <i>BUILD_VENTOOL</i>
    CMake option during <i>Venturous</i> build process prevents building and
    installing it). All available <i>Ventool</i> commands can be found by
    running <b><i>ventool&nbsp;help</i></b> command from terminal.</p>
    <p><i>Ventool</i> allows to manage playback and quit <i>Venturous</i> from
    command line. It is <b>mandatory</b> for the default <i>detached</i>
    interaction mode.
    It can also be used to create various global keyboard shortcuts. One
    shortcut can be assigned to <i>venturous</i> command
    (launching <i>Venturous</i>);
    another one - to <i>ventool quit</i> (quitting <i>Venturous</i>).
    <i>Ventool</i> playback
    commands provide global multimedia shortcuts interface.
    Exact procedure of assigning shortcuts to commands depends on
    user's desktop environment / window manager
    (it is usually quite simple).</p>


<a id="NotificationArea"><h2>Notification area icon</h2></a>
    <p>There is an option to show <i>Venturous</i> icon in notification area in
    <i>Venturous</i> preferences.
    There are also two related suboptions under this option.</p>
    <p>Notification area icon is disabled by default because many popular
    desktop environments and window managers do not support placing application
    icons in notification area or even do not have notification area at all. If
    you enable notification area icon, close <i>Preferences</i> window,
    but still can not see <i>Venturous</i> icon in notification area,
    it probably means that this feature is not supported in your environment.
    In this case it is advised to
    disable notification area icon without delay. Obviously, notification area
    icon would unjustly consume some small amount of RAM and use some processor
    time. The bigger problem with inaccessible icon is the following: if at
    least one of notification area suboptions is enabled, there can be a
    situation, when <i>Venturous</i> is running, but you have no easy access
    to its graphical user interface.
    Suboption <i>Start Venturous to notification area</i>
    is especially problematic in this case.
    Fortunately you can still issue commands via <i>Ventool</i> - and there is a
    <i>Ventool</i> command to show <i>Venturous</i> window.</p>
    <p>If you are lucky enough to have notification area icon support in your
    environment, you get several features. Left or middle click on Venturous
    notification area icon shows/hides <i>Venturous</i> window.
    Right click shows a context menu with the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Play</i></li>
        <li><i>Pause</i></li>
        <li><i>Stop</i></li>
        <li><i>Previous</i></li>
        <li><i>Next</i></li>
        <li>External player (submenu)
        <ul>
            <li><i>Show window</i></li>
            <li><i>Hide window</i></li>
            <li><i>Set essential options</i></li>
            <li><i>Update status</i></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Preferences ...</i></li>
        <li><i>Quit</i></li>
    </ul>


<a id="ConfiguringVenturous"><h2>Configuring <i>Venturous</i></h2></a>
    <h3>Compile-time configuration (CMake options and cache variables)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><i>FORCE_QT4</i> : <i>BOOLEAN</i> (default: <i>OFF</i>) -
        if enabled, <i>Qt4</i> will always be used; otherwise,
        <i>Qt5</i> is used if available.</li>
        <li><i>PREFERENCES_DIR</i> : <i>STRING</i>
        (default: <i>~/.config/venturous</i>) -
        directory that contains user preferences and playlist
        (here '~' expands to current user's <i>HOME</i> directory).</li>
        <li><i>ALWAYS_EMBED_ICONS</i> : <i>BOOLEAN</i> (default: <i>ON</i>) -
        if disabled, embedding icons will be done only in MS Windows. It is not
        recommended to switch embedding off because in this case short text
        labels instead of some icons will be displayed on toolbar. Saving less
        than 1 Mb of disk space due to smaller <i>Venturous</i> executable size
        usually isn't worth the inconvenience.
        Note: if all necessary icons are present
        in system theme (which is unlikely), there may be no need to embed
        icons.</li>
        <li><i>ADAPT_CUSTOM_ACTIONS_IF_WIN32</i> : <i>BOOLEAN</i>
        (default: <i>ON</i>) - has effect only in MS Windows. If <i>ON</i>,
        default custom actions and directory separators in paths
        passed to custom actions are adapted for MS Windows.</li>
        <li><i>DEBUG_VENTUROUS</i> : <i>BOOLEAN</i> (default: <i>OFF</i>) -
        if enabled, details of internal <i>Venturous</i> workflow will be
        written to program output (<i>stdout</i>).
        Enabling this option harms performance, so it is disabled by default.
        This option is useful during <i>Venturous</i> development.</li>
        <li><i>BUILD_VENTOOL</i> : <i>BOOLEAN</i> (default: <i>ON</i>) -
        if enabled, <i>Ventool</i> is built along with <i>Venturous</i>.
        If you do not need command line interface and global shortcuts for
        <i>Venturous</i> <b>and</b> you prefer the <i>managed</i> interaction
        mode, feel free to disable this option. Don't forget to select
        <i>Audacious (managed)</i> as an <i>External player</i> in the
        <i>Playback</i> tab of Preferences. See also
        <a href="#Ventool"><i>Ventool</i> and global shortcuts</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Run-time configuration (<i>Venturous</i> preferences)</h3>
    <p><i>Venturous</i> preferences can be accessed in several ways:
    <i>Preferences ...</i> action in <i>File</i> menu, corresponding toolbar
    button or notification area icon's context menu.
    Each option in <i>Preferences</i> has a verbose tooltip. Hover over control
    element (spinbox, checkbox or combobox) to activate tooltip.</p>
    <p><i>Preferences</i> window has five tabs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>General</i> - contains many independent option groups.
        Some of these options are described in
        <a href="#PlaylistTree">Playlist tree</a> and
        <a href="#NotificationArea">Notification area icon</a> sections.</li>
        <li><i>Playback</i> - contains playback and history options.
        Most of these options are described in
        <a href="#ManagingPlayback">Managing playback</a> and
        <a href="#PlaybackHistory">Playback history</a> sections.</li>
        <li><i>Adding directory</i> - contains policy and two editable lists:
        <i>File patterns</i>, <i>Media directory file patterns</i>.
        Adding directory policy options and pattern lists are described in
        verbose tooltips and in
        <a href="#AddingFiles">Adding files to playlist</a> section.
        Possible ways of tuning pattern lists follow.
        Checking/unchecking individual patterns is possible. Extended
        selection of patterns is supported.
        You can add new patterns using <i>Add pattern</i> button;
        edit patterns; copy patterns to another column using
        <i>Copy right</i> and <i>Copy left</i> buttons.
        Pressing one of the following keys will apply corresponding action to
        all selected patterns:
        <ul>
            <li><i>Insert</i> - check</li>
            <li><i>Backspace</i> - uncheck</li>
            <li><i>Space</i> - toggle checked state</li>
            <li><i>Delete</i> - remove</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><i>Custom actions</i> - allows customizing context menu actions on
        selected items in playlist and history. Detailed description of custom
        actions' configuration can be accessed by checking
        <i>Show help</i> checkbox under the table.
        Tooltips of buttons under the table describe effects of
        clicking these buttons. Several custom actions are available by default.
        These default custom actions are examples and can be edited or removed
        just as well as actions created by user.</li>
        <li><i>Revert/restore</i> - does not contain any options but allows to
        revert changes in other tabs. User can either revert changes
        since opening <i>Preferences</i> window or restore default values in any
        preceding tab.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are two options in <i>General</i> and <i>Playback</i> tabs
    of <i>Preferences</i> to save preferences and history to disk immediately.
    These options can be
    especially useful with desktop environments and window managers that do not
    warn <i>Venturous</i> before quit but just terminate the process.
    In this case preferences can not be saved automatically before quit,
    so saving them immediately is desirable.</p>
    <h3>Additional run-time tweaks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Resizing and moving <i>Venturous</i>, <i>History</i> and
        <i>Preferences</i> windows is possible.</li>
        <li><i>Venturous</i> toolbar has a handle that allows to detach and
        move it.
        Toolbar can be attached to any window side (top, bottom, left or right).
        In order to attach toolbar to desired <i>Venturous</i> window side, its
        handle has to be dragged to the corresponding edge of the window.</li>
        <li><i>Venturous</i> toolbar can be hidden. <i>Toolbar</i> action has to
        be toggled in context menu of main menu bar or toolbar in order to
        change toolbar's visibility.</li>
        <li>Identical moving, attaching and hiding of <i>History</i> window is
        possible. <i>History</i> window has its own title bar, which can be used
        for moving in place of toolbar handle.</li>
        <li>There is an option in <i>General</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i>:
        <i>Status bar</i>. If checked, status bar is displayed with the
        last played item label on it. If <i>History</i> window is visible,
        status bar information is redundant.
        But if <i>History</i> is hidden, status bar might be useful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All tweaks, described above, are saved to preferences and thus preserved
    between <i>Venturous</i> launches.</p>
    <p>If you want to restore default value of some option,
    quit <i>Venturous</i>; edit
    <i>&lt;Venturous preferences directory&gt;/Venturous.xml</i>:
    remove option's opening tag, closing tag and everything in between.
    For example, in order to restore Ventool check interval
    default value, you can do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Quit <i>Venturous</i>.</li>
        <li>Remove line
        <i>&lt;VentoolCheckInterval&gt;1234&lt;/VentoolCheckInterval&gt;</i>
        from <i>&lt;Venturous preferences directory&gt;/Venturous.xml</i>.</li>
        <li>Start <i>Venturous</i>. Default value of the option is restored,
        you can verify this by opening <i>Preferences</i> window.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you want to restore all default values, you can click
    <i>Restore defaults</i> button (Target tab = <i>&lt;all&gt;</i>) in
    <i>Revert/restore</i> tab of <i>Preferences</i> or just remove/rename
    file <i>Venturous.xml</i>.
    You can also copy your preferences (as well as playlist and
    history) to other user or computer by copying file(s) to the corresponding
    directory. Beware of differences in different <i>Venturous</i> versions
    though: some options are added, others are renamed or removed.
    But these differences do not usually cause any issues except that
    some options are not picked up from preferences file
    and are set to default values.</p>
